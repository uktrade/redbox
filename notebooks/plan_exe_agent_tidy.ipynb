    "Based loosely on Wang, et. al.’s paper on Plan-and-Solve Prompting, and Yohei Nakajima’s BabyAGI project, this simple architecture is emblematic of the planning agent architecture. It consists of two basic components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) A planner, which prompts an LLM to generate a multi-step plan to complete a large task.\n",
    "2) Executor(s), which accept the user query and a step in the plan and invoke 1 or more tools to complete that task.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once execution is completed, the agent is called again with a re-planning prompt, letting it decide whether to finish with a response or whether to generate a follow-up plan (if the first plan didn’t have the desired effect).\n",
    "\n",
    "This agent design lets us avoid having to call the large planner LLM for each tool invocation. It still is restricted by serial tool calling and uses an LLM for each task since it doesn't support variable assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 2 patterns that extends the plan-and-execute pattern:\n",
    "- Reasoning Without Observation (ReWOO) (Can execute multiple tasks without replaning)\n",
    "- LLM Compiler (Improve speed of task execution)\n",

    "E2: LLM[Quarterback for the first team of #E1]\n",
    "\n",
    "The planner can reference previous outputs using syntax like #E2 . This means it can execute a task list without having to re-plan every time.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) The worker node loops through each task and assigns the task output to the corresponding variable. It also replaces variables with their results when calling subsequent calls.\n",

    "##### LLM Compiler\n",
    "\n",
    "The LLMCompiler has the following main components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Planner: streams a DAG of tasks. Each task contains a tool, arguments, and list of dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Task Fetching Unit schedules and executes the tasks. This accepts a stream of tasks. This unit schedules tasks once their dependencies are met. Since many tools involve other calls to search engines or LLMs, the extra parallelism can grant a significant speed boost (the paper claims 3.6x).\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Joiner: dynamically replan or finish based on the entire graph history (including task execution results) is an LLM step that decides whether to respond with the final answer or whether to pass the progress back to the (re-)planning agent to continue work.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key runtime-boosting ideas here are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Planner outputs are streamed; the output parser eagerly yields task parameters and their dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The task fetching unit receives the parsed task stream and schedules tasks once all their dependencies are satisfied.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Task arguments can be variables, which are the outputs of previous tasks in the DAG. For instance, the model can call search(\"${1}\") to search for queries generated by the output of task 1. This lets the agent work even faster than the \"embarrassingly parallel\" tool calling in OpenAI."
