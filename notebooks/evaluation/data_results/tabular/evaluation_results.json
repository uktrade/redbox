Identify the relevant tables in the database containing information about client accounts, their associated regions/districts, and loan eligibility status.\n\n2.

Count the distinct client IDs or account IDs to get the number of unique accounts eligible for loans in the Prague region.\n\nThe SQL query for this would look something like:\n\n```sql\nSELECT COUNT(DISTINCT account_id) \nFROM account_table a\nJOIN region_table r ON a.region_id = r.region_id\nJOIN loan_eligibility_table l ON a.account_id = l.account_id\nWHERE r.region_name = 'Prague' AND l.is_eligible = 1;\n```\n\nHowever, without knowing the actual table and column names used in this particular database, I was unable to construct and execute a working query.\n\nI attempted to query the database schema multiple times using the provided sql_db_schema tool, but was unsuccessful in getting the schema information, likely due to not knowing the exact table names required as input.\n\nTo fully answer this query, I would need access to the database schema details showing the relevant tables, columns, and relationships for client account data, regional information, and loan eligibility status.

Identify the relevant loan_table_6 as it contains the amount and status columns needed.\n\n2. Filter this table to only include rows where amount < 100000 using a WHERE clause. \n\n3. From those filtered rows below $100k, count the total number of rows using COUNT(*).\n\n4.

To get the percentage, divide the 'C' status count by the total count and multiply by 100.\n\n6.
