                    Be clear and specific in your instructions. Treat Redbox as a capable but uninformed colleague. Provide context about your task and function/profession-specific terminology. Use examples when helpful, but avoid overly constraining the model.

                    While proper grammar isn't strictly necessary, clear communication is key. Focus on conveying your instructions and context accurately rather than worrying about perfect formatting.

                    Iterate on your prompt. Ask Redbox to explain its understanding of your request, then clarify or refine your instructions based on its response. Don't hesitate to have a back-and-forth dialogue to hone in on the desired output.

                    Ask Redbox to double-check its work and explain its reasoning. You can also rephrase your question or provide additional context to see if it leads to a different result. Always verify important information against original sources.
