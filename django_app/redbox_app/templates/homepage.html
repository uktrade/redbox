                    In the context of AI, a "hallucination" refers to an instance where a generative model produces information or responses that are plausible-sounding but factually incorrect or entirely fabricated. This phenomenon can occur when the model extrapolates from its training data in ways that lead to inaccuracies.

                    Redbox can get things wrong due to limitations in its training data, potential biases in the information it was trained on, and the inherent complexities of language and context.

                    Redbox does not directly include sources in its responses, as it generates information based on a wide range of training data rather than from specific, citable sources. However, it aims to provide accurate and reliable information based on common knowledge up to its last training cut-off in October 2023. If you require sourcing, it's recommended to verify the information from credible sources independently.
