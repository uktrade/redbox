# Developer Setup Guide

## Requirements

## Python Version Management Setup Guide

To ensure everyone uses the same Python version, follow one of the two options below depending on your preference or existing setup

### Option 1: Using asdf (recommended if you're using other languages too)

#### Step 1: Install asdf

Installation instructions [here](https://asdf-vm.com/guide/getting-started.html)

#### Step 2: Install the python plugin

```bash
asdf plugin add python
```

#### Step 3: Install the required Python version

From project root:

```bash
asdf install python
```

This installs and sets the local Python version for the project.

#### Step 4: Tell Poetry to use this Python

Because asdf uses shims, Poetry needs to be explicitly told what Python to use. From the project root and each individual app, run:

```bash
poetry env use $(asdf which python)
```

### Option 2: Using pyenv (recommended for python only projects)

#### Step 1: Install pyenv

Installation instructions [here](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv?tab=readme-ov-file#installation)

Restart your terminal or run

```bash
source ~/.zshrc/source ~/.bashrc
```

#### Step 2: Install the required python version

Check the projects .tool-versions or pyproject.toml. Then from the projet root, run:

```bash
pyenv install $(awk '/^python / {print $2}' .tool-versions)
pyenv local $(awk '/^python / {print $2}' .tool-versions)
```
This sets the local version in the project repository

Poetry will automatically detect the pyenv-managed Python version.

### Install project dependencies with Poetry

Once Python has been configured and installed using either pyenv or asdf, from each applications root directory (django_app, redbox-core, notebooks), run the following:

```bash
poetry install
```

### Verifying Setup

Run these to confirm:
```bash
python --version
# Should output the correct Python version

poetry run python --version
# Should also output the correct Python version

# From each application root:
poetry env info
# Should show correct path to virtualenv using that Python version
```

## Installing packages

Currently, we use [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) to manage our python packages. There are 4 `pyproject.toml`s
- [redbox-core](https://github.com/i-dot-ai/redbox/blob/main/redbox-core/pyproject.toml) - core AI package
- [django-app](https://github.com/i-dot-ai/redbox/blob/main/django_app/pyproject.toml) - django webserver and background worker
- [root](https://github.com/i-dot-ai/redbox/blob/main/pyproject.toml) - Integration tests, QA, and docs
- [notebooks](https://github.com/uktrade/redbox/blob/main/notebooks/pyproject.toml) - Jupyter notebooks

## VSCode
To make use of the VSCode setup open the workspace file .vscode/redbox.code-workspace. This will open the relevant services as roots in a single workspace. The recommended way to use this is:
* Create a venv in each of the main service directories (redbox-core, django-app) this should be in a directory called _venv_
* Configure each workspace directory to use it's own venv python interpreter. NB You may need to enter these manually when prompted as _./venv/bin/python_

The tests should then all load separately and use their own env.

## Setting environment variables

We use `.env` files to populate the environment variables for local development. When cloning the repository the file `.env.example` will be populated.

To run the project, create a new file called `.env` and populate this file with the setting names from `.env.example` and the values these settings need.

Typically this involves setting the following variables:

- `AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY` - Azure OpenAI API key
- `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT` - Azure OpenAI API key
- `OPENAI_API_VESION` - OpenAI API version

It is best to leave hostnames out of the .env file. These are then set manually by vscode tasks or pulled from a deployment .env like .env.test/.env.integration

### Backend Profiles
Redbox can use different backends for chat and embeddings, which are used is controlled by env vars. The defaults are currently to use Azure for both chat and embeddings but OpenAI can be used (and pointed to an OpenAI compliant local service).
The relevant env vars for overriding to use OpenAI embeddings are:
- `EMBEDDING_AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT` - usually the same as one of your `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT_XX`
- `EMBEDDING_OPENAI_KEY` - usually the same  as one of your `AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY_XX`



**`.env` is in `.gitignore` and should not be committed to git**



## Building and running the project

To view all the build commands, check the `Makefile` that can be found [here](https://github.com/i-dot-ai/redbox/blob/main/Makefile).

The project currently consists of multiple docker images needed to run the project in its entirety. If you only need a subsection of the project running, for example if you're only editing the django app, you can run a subset of the images. The images currently in the project are:

- `elasticsearch`
- `minio`
- `db`
- `django-app`
- `worker`

To build the images needed to run the project, use this command:

``` bash
make build
```

or

``` bash
docker compose build
```

Once those images have built, you can run them using:

``` bash
make run
```

or

``` bash
docker compose up
```

Some parts of the project can be run independently for development, for example the django application, which can be run with:

``` bash
docker compose up django-app
```

Sometimes, you might have used too much memory from previous docker runs. Memory need to be flushed before running docker. You can use the following commands:


```bash
docker system prune --all --force

DOCKER_DEFAULT_PLATFORM=linux/amd64 docker compose build

DOCKER_DEFAULT_PLATFORM=linux/amd64 docker compose up

# The DOCKER_DEFAULT_PLATFORM=linux/amd64 is only needed for certain MAC OS. You can omit this by adding the variable to your .envrc file.
```

We recommend installing direnv to prevent having to specify DOCKER_DEFAULT_PLATFORM for each docker command. To install:

``` bash
brew install direnv
```

Then add the following to your `~/.zshrc` or appropriate shell as seen [here](https://direnv.net/docs/hook.html).

``` bash
eval "$(direnv hook zsh)"
plugins=(git direnv)
```

For any other commands available, check the `Makefile` [here](https://github.com/i-dot-ai/redbox/blob/main/Makefile).

## How to run tests

Tests are split into different commands based on the application the tests are for. For each application there is a separate `make` command to run those tests, these are:

For the django app:

``` bash
make test-django
```

For the core AI:

``` bash
make test-redbox-core
```

For integration tests:

``` bash
make test-integration
```

## Logging in to Redbox Locally

We'll need to create a superuser to log in to the Django app, to do this run the following steps:

1. Come up with an email to log in with. It doesn't need to be real.
2. `docker compose run django-app venv/bin/django-admin createsuperuser`
3. Use the email you came up with in step 1, and a password (the password isn't used as we use magic links).
4. Now go to http://localhost:8080/sign-in/ enter the email you just created a super user for.
5. Press "Continue"
6. Now go to your terminal and run `make magic-link` or `docker compose logs django-app | grep 8080/magic_link`
7. Click that link and you should be logged in.

## Setting up the chat llm backend

Once the app is up and running, head to http://localhost:8080/admin/redbox_core/chatllmbackend/

Create a new chat llm backend with the following:

Name:

``` bash
# Example:
anthropic.claude-3-sonnet-20240229-v1:0
```
*This may change over time, to get the correct ID, head to amazon bedrock in the aws console > Foundation Models > model catalog > Claude 3 Sonnet > Model ID*

Provider:

``` bash
Bedrock
```

Is default:

``` bash
True
```

Enabled:

``` bash
True
```

Save and head to http://localhost:8080/admin/redbox_core/aisettings/

Ensure the default settings uses the chat backend you just created and hit save again.

Chat and document uploads should now work as expected.

## Setting up AWS credentials

To recieve responses from the LLM you will need to have access to redboc aws account (See another member of the team about requesting access).

To configure your aws profile, run the following command or manaully update your `~/.aws/config` file with assistance from another team member.

``` bash
aws configure sso
```

*Note: If using a non-default profile name, (e.g. redbox), please make sure you create an `.envrc` file with the `AWS_PROFILE` value set. See .envrc.example*

Once access has been provided and credentials configured, run the aws-login script in the project root and follow the instructions on-screen to connect.

``` bash
./aws-login.sh
```

Once authenticated you should have a `.aws` directory within the project root and notebooks app with a `credentials` file populated. This directory is added to the gitignore and should *NOT* be commited.

*Note: This script should be run periodically (daily) as the credentials will expire relatively soon.*

## Running Redbox in a notebook

There are a number of notebooks available, in various states of working! The Redbox core app is able to be created in a notebook and run to allow easy experiementation without the django side.
agent_experiments.ipynb shows this best currently.

### Configuring the notebooks kernel in vscode

In order to run notebooks in vscode, you will need to use the virtualenv created by poetry within the notebooks directory. If this does not appear as an option, you may need to add the notebooks directory path to your vscode python settings:

1. Open vscode settings: `[cmd + ,]`
2. Search: `python.venvFolders`,
3. Add the path to `./redbox/notebooks`

You may also want to add the path for the other apps in order to select the correct interpreter during development.

### Configuring notebook environment variables

Some notebooks may require specific environment variables to run. For non-sensetive variables that apply to all notebooks, add them to `.env.notebook` and override the root `.env` at the top of your notebook like so:

``` bash
dotenv .env
dotenv -o ./.env.notebook
```

For sensetive environment variables, please create a seperate `notebooks/.env` file within the notebooks directory and add them there. You can then override the `.env` and `.env.notebook` in the same way.

``` bash
dotenv .env
dotenv -o ./.env.notebook
dotenv -o ./.env
```

## Pre-commit hooks

- Download and install [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com) to benefit from pre-commit hooks
  - `pip install pre-commit`
  - `pre-commit install`

## LLM evaluation

Notebooks with some standard methods to evaluate the LLM can be found in the [notebooks/](../notebooks/) directory.

You may want to evaluate using versioned datasets in conjunction with a snapshot of the pre-embedded vector store.

We use [elasticsearch-dump](https://github.com/elasticsearch-dump/elasticsearch-dump) to save and load bulk data from the vector store.

### Installing Node and `elasticsearch-dump`

Install [Node and `npm`](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) (Node package manager) if you don't already have them. We recommend using [`nvm`](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm?tab=readme-ov-file#installing-and-updating) (Node version manager) to do this.

If you're familiar with Node or use it regularly we recommend following your own processes or the tools' documentation. We endeavour to provide a quickstart here which will install `nvm`, Node, `npm` and `elasticsearch-dump` globally. This is generally not good practise.

To install `nvm`:

```console
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.7/install.sh | bash
```

Restart your terminal.

Install Node.

```console
nvm install node
nvm use --lts
```

Verify installation.

```console
node --version
```

Install `elasticsearch-dump` globally.

```console
npm install elasticdump -g
```

### Dumping data from Elasticsearch

The default indicex we want is `redbox-data-chunk`

Dump these to [data/elastic-dumps/](../data/elastic-dumps/) for saving or sharing.

```console
elasticdump \
  --input=http://localhost:9200/redbox-data-chunk \
  --output=./data/elastic-dumps/redbox-data-chunk.json \
  --type=data
```

### Loading data to Elasticsearch

If you've been provided with a dump from the vector store, add it to [data/elastic-dumps/](../data/elastic-dumps/). The below assumes the existance of `redbox-data-chunk.json` in that directory.

Consider dumping your existing indices if you don't want to have to reembed data you're working on.

Start the Elasticsearch service.

```console
docker compose up -d elasticsearch
```

Load data from your JSONs, or your own file.

```console
elasticdump \
  --input=./data/elastic-dumps/redbox-data-chunk.json \
  --output=http://localhost:9200/redbox-data-chunk \
  --type=data
```

If you're using this index in the frontend, you may want to upload the raw files to MinIO, though that's out of scope for this guide.
